# TL;DR

If a company uses Microsoft Entra ID Single Sign-On, you can often locate
externally facing SSO apps by searching for auth flow callback URLs in
[URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io/). 

I published the script to automate the process described in this post
[here](https://gist.github.com/cramppet/455ed8fe00c11b76efc7dbd25b1ed199).

# Introduction 

In the current business landscape, cloud computing has gained significant
popularity as a means for enterprises to host their applications. Unfortunately,
traditional methods of asset identification (footprinting) face challenges when
it comes to pinpointing cloud-based resources.

This difficulty arises because these assets are often hosted on domains that are
not directly linked to the organization itself. Instead, they are provided by
third-party service providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, or Google. Moreover,
many SaaS products also use their own domains for hosting tenant sites; some
notable examples are Adobe, Zendesk, and Salesforce.

Regardless of where they are, we want to be able to identify such externally
facing, cloud-hosted applications, especially those that allow for users to
authenticate. Knowledge of such applications is useful for building phishing
campaigns, and in general to understand what software is in use by the
organization.

# A Method of Discovery

Many organizations are using **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly known as Azure AD)
for IAM. For reference, here's how Microsoft describes this offering:

>Microsoft Entra ID is a cloud-based identity and access management service
>that enables your employees access external resources. Example resources
>include Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other SaaS
>applications. (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/whatis)

## Finding the Tenant ID

One of the most important attributes for any organization using Entra ID is
their **tenant ID**. This GUID value is easily discoverable, uniquely identifies
the organization, and provides a useful keyword search term for OSINT
collection. You can find the tenant ID of any organization by using the
following well-known URL:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-domain>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Assuming the organization is using Entra ID in some capacity, you should be able
to collect the tenant ID from the response:

## Searching for SSO-enabled Apps

While not the only option, in this post, I'll talk about using
[URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io/) as the data source to search in.

URLScan is, in my opinion, still an underutilized OSINT source. It describes
itself as a "Sandbox for the web" and invites everyone to submit URLs for
analysis. Notably, since URLScan offers a submission API, it is commonly used to
perform analysis on URLs submitted from several automated sources.

![URLScan Submission Types](./urlscan-submission-types.png)

These products generally have a great deal of visibility into areas that we
normally would not see. Moreover, many URL submissions, whether they are
automatic or manual, are not done in a privacy-conscious way, and scan results
are left in the `Public` data bucket. In practice this means that we can find
interesting "deep links" that we normally would have no visibility of.

The final piece of the puzzle in finding SSO apps is the connection to the
tenant IDs from above. While not every application works this way, many
application authentication flows typically involve a step that redirects to a
URL that will contain the authorizing organization's tenant ID. Such steps are
commonly found in the OAuth and SAML authentication flows:

![OAuth2 Token Flow](./oauth-token-flow.png)

Our task now is to search on URLScan for any occurrences of the tenant ID within
a URL's path component.

Conveniently, URLScan allows for exactly this type of querying **but you need to
register for a free account**; this is so we can use the regex based search
feature within the URL path like so
`page.url:*5cbd3855-ce3c-4b95-a24a-3779a0405381*`:

![Searching on URLScan](./urlscan-search.png)

You'll notice that there are several SAML callback URLs shown containing the
tenant ID we searched for. Each of these occurrences is for some SSO-enabled
application/service that attempted to perform a SAML authentication flow. Now,
we can navigate to each result link and determine the original URL submission to
reveal what the application/service was that triggered the SAML flow:

## Automating the process

It's no fun to do this manually, and we can write some simple code to make this
task easy for ourselves!

**Note:** To use the code below you'll need to create an API key for URLScan and
export it as an environment variable `URLSCAN_API_KEY`.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import json
import argparse
import urllib.request


URLSCAN_API_KEY = os.environ.get("URLSCAN_API_KEY", None)


def get_tenant_id(domain):
    """retrieves the organization tenant ID from well-known endpoint"""
    url = f'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration'
    res = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read())
    if "error" in res:
        print('[!]', res['error_description'])
        return ""
    return res['issuer'].split('/')[3]


def search_for_tenant_id(tenant_id):
    """searches on URLscan for tenant ID, extracts original task URLs"""
    url = f'https://urlscan.io/api/v1/search?q=page.url:*{tenant_id}*'
    try:
        req = urllib.request.Request(url)
        req.add_header('api-key', URLSCAN_API_KEY)
        res = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
        data = json.loads(res.read())
        for item in data['results']:
            print(item['task']['url'])
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as ex:
        print('[!]', ex)


def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='')
    parser.add_argument('domain')
    args = vars(parser.parse_args())

    if URLSCAN_API_KEY is None:
        print('[!] Environment variable "URLSCAN_API_KEY" not set')
        exit(1)

    tenant_id = get_tenant_id(args['domain'])
    if tenant_id != "":
        print('[+] Using tenant ID value:', tenant_id)
        print('[*] Searching for deep-links...')
        search_for_tenant_id(tenant_id)
        print('[+] Done!')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The code should hopefully be fairly self-explanatory, here's an example run for
the same `nytimes.com` domain we've been using:

![Using the Automated Tool](./using-tool.png)

# Conclusion

In the output above, it should be noted that 2 of the 4 results were under the
`nyt.net` domain. These subdomains would hopefully be caught by any footprinting
process, rendering those results unimportant for us to consider here.

The other two instances are more interesting. The `nytsecurity.zendesk.com`
hostname is not something that would normally be found during a traditional
footprint unless some extenuating circumstance was present, ex. DNS CNAME
record that is easily discoverable.

Finding the public Workday portal for the NYT organization is fairly easy to do,
but the link shown above appears to be for internal consumption. Subtle details
found in links like these can sometimes aid in making more convincing phishing
emails/lures.

One final note is that as mentioned above, URLScan is not the only source that
you can use to search for links like this. Searching Google, GitHub, and Postman
with a tenant ID can often yield interesting results, including more impactful
OSINT discoveries like credentials.
